        <h1>Benefits of Investing in Team building</h1>
        <img src="img/blog/Picture2.png" class="cs_main">
        <p>For decades one of the most common strategy companies have been using to build successful team is Internship program. Many companies in nearly every industry offer internship programs. They can vary in length, level of responsibility and pay and there are benefits for both the employer and the intern. Taking part in an internship can help intern to gain experience in a career field and lead to opportunities for future jobs. In short team employer invest in training and identifying best candidates based on performance during internship.</p>
        <p>Companies can select and develop future talent through internships and increase their staff retention rates, since many interns secure job offers after their internship ends. As a former intern, you assimilate into the new role faster than an external hire might. Employers can hold various social activities and professional development seminars to learn more about each intern and how they may be a good permanent addition to the team.</p>

        <img src="img/blog/2_2.png" alt="" class="fig_img">

        <p class="blog_parahead">New Talent and Skills</p>
        <p>Millennials are the most educated generation in history. They bring understanding and skills to the workforce that are often unexpected by their superiors but extremely valuable.</p>

        <p class="blog_parahead">Fresh External Vision</p>
        <p>Undergraduates, Graduates and PhD holders spend hours studying a variety of theories and philosophies in their college courses, which often means that they can often share new ideas and insights.</p>

        <p class="blog_parahead">Community Involvement</p>
        <p>A successful intern is likely to tell people about their experience, and this type of publicity sheds a positive light on the employer’s reputation. At eShocan we would like to build a relationship with local universities and create awareness about our program.</p>

        <p class="blog_parahead">Easy to train company culture</p>
        <p>Employment after internship is the first job for any employee. Employers hire full time employee from the pool of interns, it will be easy to train company culture and processes as they have not exposed to any other corporate culture. Fresh employee out of college is always open to learn and it’s easy to mold to company culture.</p>

        <p class="blog_parahead">Higher retention</p>
        <p>Employees hired from the pool of internship will have a lot to learn and gain industry expertise. Employers get enough time to read employees interest, their skills and their career growth interest, which will help to retain them longer.</p>

        <p class="blog_parahead">Flexibility to manage workload </p>
        <p>Employers get to assign different responsibility to assess their interest, which gives employers great deal of flexibility for handling workload for short period of time</p>

        <p class="blog_parahead">Conclusion</p>
        <p>Employers can reap great benefits from hiring interns if they will prepare a plan for their interns, establish expectations during the hiring process, and maintain open communication throughout the program. Students want to learn and contribute, and companies want to increase profitability. If both groups can work together to accomplish these goals, internships can be an extremely valuable investment.</p>
